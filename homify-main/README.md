## 📖 Firebase Fetching Methods Explained

In this project, data is fetched and synced using the modern Firebase Modular SDK (v9+). 

### `onValue` vs `get`
- **`onValue`**: Sets up an active listener. Every time the data changes in the database, the callback function is triggered automatically, keeping the UI in perfect sync with the backend. *This is ideal for a real-time IoT dashboard where device statuses update frequently.*
- **`get`**: Fetches the data exactly once. It does not listen for future changes. *This is better for one-off reads, like fetching a user profile on load, to save bandwidth.*
